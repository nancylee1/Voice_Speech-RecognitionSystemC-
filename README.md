<h1> About this Project </h1>
This is an all C# Voice/speaker recognition tool using WinFormApp .Net Framework with the ability to receive and interpret dictation and carry out a 
few spoken commands such as: "What date or time is it?" Kind of like an infant :baby: version of 'Siri' or 'Alexa'. 

<h1> Can I try it? </h1>

Yes! You can fork and clone this from Github to your local computer, open the Visual Studio Solution file, and press play! You may need to use your headphones with microphone as 
the program will need to clearly hear your voice to hear and list the commands. Thank you taking a look!
